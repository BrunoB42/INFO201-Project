## Data Description



## Specific Question Analyses
### Is there a correlation between health expenditure and healthy life expectancy?

The health expenditure dataset includes a value that is the the percent of Gross Domestic Product(GDP), a representation of the monetary value of goods and services, that each country is spending on health care costs within a year. The question attempts to answer if the % of GDP spent contributes to higher or lower life expectancies. I took the average percent of GDP spent on healthcare and compared it to the average life expectancies for each country.
