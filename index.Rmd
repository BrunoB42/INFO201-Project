## Problem Domain Description


## Data Description
```{r health, echo = FALSE}
life_average_plot
```

This histogram displays the distribution of average healthy life expectancies of countries from 2000 - 2018. The minimum average health life expectancy in this plot is `r summary_stats[[1]]`years and the maximum average health life expectancy is `r summary_stats[[6]]` years. The average life expectancy for citizens in the countries listed in two data sets is about `r summary_stats[[4]]` years. The histogram reveals the that distrubition is suffiently uneven with some extreme values and there may be factors to further explore that are contributing to it.
