## Problem Domain Description



## Data Description
```{r us_debt_over_time, echo = FALSE}
us_debt_over_time_plot
```

The data set of debt in the US from 2006 to 2016 does not have significant outliers, but rather shows a positive trend throughout the years. Although the difference in the debt percentage from 2006 to 2016 is `r us_debt_summary$range`, the debt percentage grew rapidly each year. The correlation between the years and percentages is `r us_debt_correlation[1, 2]` and the average percentage of debt is `r us_debt_summary$mean`.
